# CommentWall
A site i will Keep updated with the current link to The Comment wall
Ok so im currently working on this application on a low budget so i have to go through a third party to provide a public link which may cause the site to crash every so often but if or when it does I will try to get it back up as soon as possible and you can find the new links below. The second link may never crash espeacialy if i get enough traffic to fund it but the first time you click it you will get a warning because this app requires a database to function but i can promise you the only thing on the database is what we already see on the page it has to be stored somewhere which i think makes w3 a bit hypocritical but hey.
